# Move To Jekyll

Yesterday I migrated my blog from WordPress to Jekyll. this is actually not the first time I have changed the system of my blog. I've been looking for a blogging system that is simple in functionality and requires only content maintenance, not stability. So far I see that Jekyll is a better choice. The content is maintained on GitHub Pages, which requires a bit of configuration the first time, and subsequently I just write Markdown, commit and push. Writing content is the same as writing code.

At present, it seems that Jekyll meets all my requirements, the follow-up whether to access plug-ins to achieve more functionality or continue to change the blog system we will see. ü§îÔ∏è
