# Multiplex Ethernet Cable Using Managed Switch

Recently I moved to an apartment with a very limited network infrastructure for my personal use. There is only one ethernet 
cable between the network case and the living room where I decided to put my TV and wireless router.

This situation requires me to multiplex the only one cable in the wall. After some study about the managed switch and the 
VLAN technology. I have built a home network like the below structure. For now, I'm fully satisfied with this solution.
